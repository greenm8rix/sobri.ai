            <h2>2. How Our AI Works</h2>
            <p>
              Our AI uses natural language processing to understand your messages and generate helpful responses. The system is trained on a wide range of recovery-related information but does not provide medical advice or treatment.

              <li>It may occasionally generate incorrect or incomplete information</li>
              <li>It cannot diagnose medical conditions or provide personalized medical advice</li>
              <li>It cannot contact emergency services if you are in crisis</li>
              <li>It may not always understand complex emotional states or nuanced situations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Usage for AI Improvement</h2>
            <p>
              With your permission, we may use anonymized conversations to improve our AI system. All personal identifiers are removed before any data is used for training or improvement purposes.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Human Oversight</h2>
            <p>
              Our system includes human oversight processes to review and improve AI responses, especially for sensitive topics. Any human review of conversations is conducted with strict privacy protocols.
